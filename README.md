<p>Project: Basic AI Chatbot
<br>
Description: This code snippet demonstrates a simple command-line chatbot application that uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model for generating responses. Here's a brief description of its functionality:
<br>
1. Introduction: The chatbot greets the user and prompts them to enter a question.
<br>
2. API Key Check: It verifies if the OpenAI API key is set in the environment. If the API key is missing, it provides instructions for obtaining and setting the API key.
<br>
3. Interaction Loop: The main loop of the program repeatedly: - Takes a user question as input. - Sends the question to the OpenAI API and receives a response. - Displays the response to the user. - Asks if the user wants to continue or exit. 4. Exit Condition: If the user chooses to stop, the chatbot thanks the user and terminates the program.
<br>
This script utilizes OpenAI's Python library to interface with the GPT-3.5 model, ensuring an interactive and dynamic user experience.

NOTE: The whole folder of the project is not uplodaded in github due to some technical reasons. The code is working correct without any error. You may need a API for making it work. API cannot be shared becasue it has limited credits and i need it in further orijects too. So the python code is provided.
